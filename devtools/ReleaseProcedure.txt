The maven release plugin turned out to be too hard to handle.
So we do it manually.

# Ensure all has been committed

# Ensure it all works
mvn clean package
mvn clean

# Creating and publishing the new Tagging
RELEASEVERSION=2.0
mvn versions:set -DgenerateBackupPoms=false -DnewVersion=${RELEASEVERSION}

# Update the version number in all of the examples in the README*md files
vim README*.md

git status
git commit -m"Version ${RELEASEVERSION}" -a
git tag -a v${RELEASEVERSION} -m"Tag Version ${RELEASEVERSION}"

NEXTVERSION=2.1
mvn versions:set -DgenerateBackupPoms=false -DnewVersion=${NEXTVERSION}-SNAPSHOT
git commit -m"Start development for ${NEXTVERSION}" -a

git push
git push origin v${RELEASEVERSION}


# These two profiles are defined in ~/.m2/settings.xml
git checkout v${RELEASEVERSION}
mvn clean deploy -Prelease -Pdeploy-local

VERIFY If this all looks good

mvn clean deploy -Prelease -Pdeploy-sonatype

git checkout master
